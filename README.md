This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# UdemyFaceRecognition

This application is a facerecognition app, that was used to learn React, heroku deployment, and front end web development. It is an app that allows users to register and sign in, and submit images to have faces detected use Clarafai's API. The number of faces detected are counted and displayed, and kept track of in the backend.

This project also continued afterwards, and was included in further work in the course to learn about redux, security and user authentication using JWT, and other topics. Those versions are in repos that contain the majority of the problems and exercises done throughout those courses.
